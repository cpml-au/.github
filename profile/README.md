## Computational Physics and Machine Learning Lab

**Aarhus University, Denmark.**

The _Computational Physics and Machine Learning_ lab fosters the use of machine learning and advanced computational techniques for the data-driven modeling of complex systems.  Special focus is on the development of novel algorithms that can discover the governing equations underlying some phenomena starting from experimental measurements or other type of data.

In contrast with purely data-driven methods and current trends in AI and ML, we strive to obtain _interpretable_ models that generalize well on unseen data, and can provide guarantees on their _safety_ and _reliability_. To achieve these goals, we use a combination of equation-based modeling and machine learning techniques, including symbolic regression, evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning and deep neural networks.
